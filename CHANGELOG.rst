0.3.3
=====

(Non-officiel release)
* Improve nodes endpoint with_status arg
* Handle puppetdb bug with noop and noop_pending null values

0.3.2
=====

* Fixed noop puppet runs reporting unchanged instead of noop.
* Fixed unreported nodes shown as 'noop' in puppetdb > 4.1.0.
* Add Inventory API endpoint for PuppetDB 4.2.0.
* Support for producer field on catalogs, facts and report types.

0.3.1
=====

* Fixed a datetime related bug in :func:`pypuppetdb.api.nodes()` that caused
  all returned nodes to be an unreported status

0.3.0
=====

* New QueryBuilder module allows users to build PuppetDB queries in an
  Object-Oriented fashion.
* Adding support for new fields provided in PuppetDB 4.1.0.

0.2.3

  resource events data timestamps are not parseable.
* Escaping additional path parameters passed to _url() with urllib.quote

0.2.2
=====

* Fixed URL Encoding found when querying the specific value of a macaddress
  fact. 
* Adding support for PuppetDB 4.0.0 information. Namely Adding a catalog_uuid
  attribute to the Catalog type object. Adding code_id, catalog_uuid and
  cached_catalog_status attributes to the Report type object.
* Removing unneeded sudo option from .travis.yml, this gave unnecessary
  warning in the test environment.
* Updating the files under docs/ so https://pypuppetdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
  can be updated
* Deprecating :func:`pypuppetdb.types.Report.events()` in favour of the new

0.2.1
=====

* Adding a version comparison utility function using examples provided in
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1714027/version-number-comparison
* Adding a new variable latest_report_hash to the Node object. Default
  None but is given a real value from the field of the same name in the
  Nodes endpoint available in PuppetDB 3.2 or higher.
* Allowing support for 'GET' AND 'POST' requests in the api _query()
  function. This will allow clients to send requests to the PuppetDB that
  are too long for a GEt request query string
* Adding a node field, code_id, to the Catalog object using the field of
  the same name from the Catalogs endpoint (currently unused as of
  PuppetDB 3.2.2)
* Adding test cases for new features EXCEPT the GET and POST update.

0.2.0
=====

* Version bump to 0.2.0
* Adding support for v4 of the Query API
* Removing v2 and v3 api functions as per changelog
* pypuppetdb will no longer support multiple API versions, removing the
  api_version attribute from pypuppetdb.connect() 
* All clients must remove the api_version attribute from the connect function,
  or the starting number, since it is no longer supported
* Removing all NotImplemented errors in the function of BaseAPI and filled
  them with the real code

New Features
------------

New endpoints:

* ``environments``: ``environments()``
* ``factsets``: ``factsets()``
* ``fact-paths``: ``fact_paths()``
* ``fact-contents``: ``fact_contents()``
* ``edges``: ``edges()``

Changes to Types:

* ``pypupperdb.types.Report`` now requires ``api`` to be passed as the second
  argument, this allows to directly query for any events that occurred in this
  report object. This functionality was proposed and denied because of backward
  compatability reasons, since the previous versions are now removed this is no
  longer a problem.
* All ``pypupperdb.types.*`` accept the v4 API information as optional parameters.
  These parameters are primarily environment related but may include additional
  information if provided from that endpoint.
* Functions appearing inside ``pypuppetdb.types`` that run queries against the
  PuppetDB now accept and passing additional keyword arguments to the query.
* All ``pypuppetdb.BaseAPI`` functions pass any received keyword arguments to the
  ``pypuppetdb.api.__init__._query()`` function. This allows for easy integration
  with paging functions and parameters.

0.1.1
=====

* Fix the license in our ``setup.py``. The license shouldn't be longer than
  200 characters. We were including the full license tripping up tools like
  bdist_rpm.

0.1.0
=====
Significant changes have been made in this release. The complete v3 API is
now supported except for query pagination.

Most changes are backwards compatible except for a change in the SSL
configuration. The previous behaviour was buggy and slightly misleading in
the names the options took:

* ``ssl`` has been renamed to ``ssl_verify`` and now defaults to ``True``.
* Automatically use HTTPS if ``ssl_key`` and ``ssl_cert`` are provided.

For additional instructions about getting SSL to work see the Quickstart
in the documentation.

Deprecation
------------
Support for API v2 will be dropped in the 0.2.x release series.

New features
------------

The following features are **only** supported for **API v3**.

The ``node()`` and ``nodes()`` function have gained the following options:

  * ``with_status=False``
  * ``unreported=2``

When ``with_status`` is set to ``True`` an additional query will be made using
the ``events-count`` endpoint scoped to the latest report. This will result in
an additional ``events`` and ``status`` keys on the node object. ``status``
will be either of ``changed``, ``unchanged`` or ``failed`` depending on if
``events`` contains ``successes`` or ``failures`` or none.

By default ``unreported`` is set to ``2``. This is only in effect when
``with_status`` is set to ``True``. It means that if a node hasn't checked in
for two hours it will get a ``status`` of ``unreported`` instead.

New endpoints:

  * ``events-count``: ``events_count()``
  * ``aggregate-event-counts``: ``aggregate_event_counts()``
  * ``server-time``: ``server_time()``
  * ``version``: ``current_version()``
  * ``catalog``: ``catalog()``

New types:

  * ``pypuppetdb.types.Catalog``
  * ``pypuppetdb.types.Edge``

Changes to types:

  * ``pypuppetdb.types.Node`` now has:
    * ``status`` defaulting to ``None``
    * ``events`` defaulting to ``None``
    * ``unreported_time`` defaulting to ``None``

0.0.4
=====

Due to a fairly serious bug 0.0.3 was pulled from PyPi minutes after release.

When a bug was fixed to be able to query for all facts we accidentally
introduced a different bug that caused the ``facts()`` call on a node to
query for all facts because we were resetting the query.

* Fix a bug where ``node.facts()`` was causing us to query all facts because
  the query to scope our request was being reset.

0.0.3
=====

With the introduction of PuppetDB 1.5 a new API version, v3, was also
introduced. In that same release the old ``/experimental`` endpoints
were removed, meaning that as of PuppetDB 1.5 with the v2 API you can
no longer get access to reports or events.

In light of this the support for the experimental endpoints has been
completely removed from pypuppetdb. As of this release you can only get
to reports and/or events through v3 of the API.

This release includes preliminary support for the v3 API. Everything that
could be done with v2 plus the experimental endpoints is now possible on
v3. However, more advanced funtionality has not yet been implemented. That
will be the focus of the next release.

* Removed dependency on pytz.
* Fixed the behaviour of ``facts()`` and ``resources()``. We can now
  correctly query for all facts or resources.
* Fixed an issue with catalog timestampless nodes.
* Pass along the ``timeout`` option to ``connect()``.
* Added preliminary PuppetDB API v3 support.
* Removed support for the experimental endpoints.
* The ``connect()`` method defaults to API v3 now.

0.0.2
=====
* Fix a bug in ``setup.py`` preventing successful installation.

0.0.1
=====
Initial release. Implements most of the v2 API.
